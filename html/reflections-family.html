        The family website was my first big project. At the time, I only knew html and css, so the whole thing is done in those languages. I also borrowed a jQuery plug-in called fancybox. All of the original stuff is in html and css.

        To make this website, first I looked at other web templates. I had no idea what to do, so I looked to what others had done. I found several ones that I liked on <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/">Template Monster</a>, but none of them were specifically for a "Family Website." I picked and chose from these templates. I took the navbar and header section from one, but I borrowed the center section from another. It is a mashup of several. I put all of these in a Photoshop document which allowed me to reference my design to the exact pixel.

        Having made the mockup website, I could begin coding the website. This was a grueling task. I did so many parts differently that I would now. I used a ton of terrible web development practices and was extremely limited in my knowledge base having not learned any scripting. But, eventually after hours of work, it began to come together. I added several features that were not required, and I was able to reuse about 90% of my stylings between pages which made development happen faster with progress. I was able to finish the project on time; however, there are several issues I have with the project.

        I have mentioned several previously: the limitations of only using html and css. But there are multitudes. One of the most glaring, which is shown in the embed in this portfolio website, is that the family website is fixed in one size. There is no size change for any viewport. It is as fixed as any website could get. Another complaint I have with this website is that it does not take advantage of the ease of Bootstrap. Currently, I would never make a website without Bootstrap. It makes so many tasks easy, but I did not make this website with it. That is a real deal breaker for making it responsive or adding better methods for showing information. Now that I have more experience, there are so many issues that I have with this website, but I don't think that I will change it being my first website. I think for that fact, I like it rather a lot.
