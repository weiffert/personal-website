        I really enjoyed the Web Design and Scripting course. I think I know html and css very well, and I am enjoying to learn JavaScript and jQuery. Moreover, I have learned how to use BootStrap which is an invaluable tool. Going into this course, I had never opened up a text editor for any of these languages or used Photoshop. I had utterly no experience, but I knew that this class would teach me the necessary tools to be able to design and code a great website. That is exactly what happened. Our teacher, Patrick Sasser started me with learning the basics: html and css. That is all we focused on for the whole first semester, and so I feel that I have a great handle on how to operate those languages. I think that I am competent, although there is always more to learn. Coming into second semester, I knew that the class would hit JavaScript and jQuery, for they are necessary to making a modern website. What I didn't know is that we would be learning Bootstrap. These last three subjects I am still learning, but I have a better grasp on them now than at the beginning of the semester.

        Throughout the class, we were learning design, design tools, and practiced making website mockups. These were invaluable to learning how to make a website look good, for if a web developer knows only how to code a website, they will not be able to make it look good. The task of learning how to use Photoshop was a monumental obstacle for me since I took the class from the C++ Programming branch instead of the Digital Media branch. I had to learn it on my own, and it was rough. I worked harder and longer at making the website mockups than my peers for I had to learn every task. But now, I am an Adobe Certified Associate. I have learned how to use Photoshop effectively. However, just being able to use a program does not mean that you can make good design. I have also learned design principles that help guide a viewer's eye and make a website easy to navigate and remember. Design principles are a part of the foundation of web development. Whatever that is made has to be usable. Otherwise, it is worthless. So, through this class, I have learned design principles and tools that allow me to create an awesome website.

        Of the things that were not the best, I wish I knew better designs for mobile layouts and alternative designs. I also wish that I knew scripting languages better and had more practice with them. I think that it will become almost impossible to make a good, responsive, dynamic website without them. One thing I wish I had learned in this class is working with files, storing data, and other things like that. All of these service based websites require knowing these skills, but the class did not cover them. Furthermore, I would love to learn website encryption such as sensitive data handling. I think that it would be a very interesting field of study. What I am getting at is that my only complaint with this class is that there is not enough time to learn and practice all of these things to a high level. There is so much to learn and not enough time to do it.

        After taking this class, since I now know html, css, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Photoshop, I want to make websites both for fun and for contracting. I still want to focus in Computer Science, but I also want to work on my web skills some more since they are so easily employable. This summer, I plan to make a website for a dietician and to make another for a friend's video studio. There are definitely places that I can go with this knowledge and places that I do plan to go, but I need to continue to hone in my skills and learn new methods and designs. Web Design and Scripting will remain an important part of my developing career.
