        This is the second big website project that I had worked on. I performed some club research on <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/">Template Monster</a>, and these I used to a great extent. The home page borrows colors, an events bar, and a footer from one, but from another, I borrowed the header splash section, the sticky navbar, and other elements. Once again, it is a confluence of several previous designs. As before, they were compiled in a photoshop document. When I transferred it to code, I tried to remain as true as possible to the mock up website.

        When making this website, I had a great asset on my side: I had begun practicing JavaScript and jQuery. I had learned the basics and I was now implementing them. Furthermore, I had learned how to use Bootstrap, a necessary resource. Being my first Bootstrap website, I did not realize how amazing it is. I will never design a website without something similar to Bootstrap. It is amazing how useful it is. When making it, I also had practice with implementing another ready made system called RoyalSlider. It is a more advanced Bootstrap Carousel. The rest of the website came together well. I got practice with embeds and was amazed. In this website, I embed a Google Forms, videos, and social media profiles. This was also my first exposure to iframes. I love all of the new elements I learned from this project.

        There are several changes that I would want to make with this website, the first of which being that it is not responsive. It is not dynamic to screen size, and that is necessary in today's modern world. Everybody needs to be able to access a mobile format. Also, the formatting gets all wonky when the website viewport gets small. Nothing changes size, but it is not fixed like the Family Website. Another issue with it is that the navbar does not have an active navigation. That is a major design error. Furthermore, the text is very boring. It is not very interesting to look at and is very static. These are several things I could have done to increase the usability of this website.
